# HM_Data_Science

### This repository contains code for the Data Science Assessment organised by the HM Land Registry.

### I was supposed to perform one of the Natural Language Programming, Computer Vision, and Graphs task, and I have chosen **Natural Language Programming** task for the assessment. 

#### According to my understanding, I have performed the task in two parts: 
#### - Part 1: Classification of the text from the 1000 test samples. 
#### - Part 2: Extraction of the Location and Date entities from the texts in the test sample. 

## Part 1: Text Classification

Dataset: (ecthr_a) The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) hears allegations that a state has breached human rights provisions of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). For each case, the dataset provides a list of factual paragraphs (facts) from the case description. Each case is mapped to articles of the ECHR that were violated (if any). There are 10 classes of voilations and some examples where there are no voilations so total of 11 classes. This is a multi-label classification problem.
